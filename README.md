AgileX, a project managment tool
I built AgileX as a school project. It's currently one and a half weeks in development.
It's built with html / css / javascript / angular / node / express / and mongodb.
It has many features and still has many to be added.
Features
Messaging | send, reply, mark as urgent, notification of new messages, and delete.

Add Projects and Stories | choose contributing users, effort for each project, notes, etc...

Analytics | view progress on stories and projects.

Login / Registration.

Company Info | relevant news and info from various api's.

The project is still in development and has many features to be added

Calender | add events, rsvp to events, etc...

CodeShare | Live pair-programming from anywhere.

Git Hub Integration | Post to github using their api.

Profile's | add pictures, information and status updates.

I've made most of the features from scratch.
Multi-select list's, graphs, and the CodeShare / Calender programs that are in development.
I've had many challenges along with many wins. The css and styling has proven the most dificult but I've found I really like working with the mongoDB database.
I'm excited to see how far I can take this project.
Thanks for you're time and feedback.
